## Improvements: NodeJS

**Original:**

>NodeJS ecosystem is very big and it is still growing day by day. It is an asynchronous event driven environment that uses google's v8 engine to run javascript. V8 is the same engine used in google chrome to run JavaScript.

>As it is asynchronous in nature, you should be able to leverage or handle it efficiently. So I highly recommend that once you finish this guide, you read about callback hell and promises.

>This article will focus on covering the tools that will help you as a beginner to better understand the environment. Hovever, if you're already a NodeJS developer then you might already know these.

>The official docs explains NodeJS very efficiently in a concise manner. If you're interested then give it 5 minutes of your time. This article will focus on covering the tools that will help you as a beginner to better understand the environment. Hovever,

**Improved:**

NodeJS is an asynchronous, event driven environment that uses google's v8 engine to run javascript. Node's asynchronous architecture, helpful community, and vast number of third-party packages reduces development time and helps get projects of the ground quickly. 

This article will focus on discussing the tools and techniques necessary for beginners to get started with NodeJS. If you're already an experienced developer, feel free to read along (you might learn some new tips and tricks); however, if would like more in-depth information, see: [Node's Official Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/). 

## Improvements: Data Types

**Original:**

>The Data Type of a variable plays an important role in statistics which must be understood, to correctly apply statistical measurements to your data. In statistics, the term "Measurement Scale" may be used as well.‚Äù

**Improved:**

In order to ensure accurate and useful analysis of data, the correct statisical data type (also known as Measurement Scale) must be identified and applied to each variable or metric. 

## Webhook Tutorial

## Recommendations for Improving Webhook Documentation

I would mention somewhere that, before the node app is started up, its expected for ngrok to show a 404/502 response when browsing to the ngrok URL. Seems kinda obvious in hindsight, but might not be obvious to someone setting it up for the first time. Something like "Now that you've started ngrok, go ahead and browse to the specified URL. You should get a 404 response -- this okay because we haven't started the app yet..."  

## Writing Samples

* [Publishing an API APP](https://support.americommerce.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004253313-Publishing-an-API-App) -- Written for AmeriCommerce. Prior to this article's publication, there wasn't a public-facing document for developer's to reference; I wrote it from the ground-up.
* [Shipping Overview](https://support.americommerce.com/hc/en-us/articles/220217788-Shipping-Overview)- Written for AmeriCommerce. Prior to this, there were lots of shipping articles about specific topics, but nothing that tied them all together and gave a high-level explanation the shipping system; I wrote this article for that purpose.
* [Adding a Custom Checkout Message](https://support.americommerce.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003487134-Adding-a-Custom-Checkout-Message) -- I wrote this specifically to help one client; however, turned out to be handy for others as well. 
* [Twitter API Authentication Using C# and .NET's HttpClient](http://www.aglensmith.com/twitter-api-authentication/) -- a blog post I made while working on a learning project. 
* [beaumont.js: Calling All SETX Coders](http://www.aglensmith.com/calling-all-setx-coders/) -- Another blog post about a local JS group.
